# Setup/Cross-compiling U-Boot

## U-Boot for dummies

U-Boot (short universal bootloader) is a an open-source bootloader used in embedded devices to perform various low-level hardware initialization tasks and subsequently boot the operating system kernel.
In zynq systems, u-boot will load a boot script (boot.scr) which perform the following actions :

    - Flash the bistream to configure the FPGA.
    - Parse an embedded device tree blob (dtb) to prepare the board peripherals.
    - Load the kernel.

## Implementation

### Download device tree resource Xilinx
Xilinx publishes its own fork of u-boot in the following git repository : https://github.com/Xilinx/u-boot-xlnx.git
The repository is organized in multiple branches targeting specific versions of Vivado. According to your **Vivado's version**, It is **_Very crucial_** choosing the right branch corresponding to 
Vivado's version or maybe the same year or you never know why it doesn't work.
In my experiment, I was using Vivado 2023.1. Therefore, the Xilinx's folder that I downloaded always had branch version as 2023.1 or atleast 2023.

```shell
# Inside the same folder LinuxZedboard
# Clone the repo with the matching branch
git clone -b xlnx_rebase_v2023.01 https://github.com/Xilinx/u-boot-xlnx.git
cd u-boot-xlnx
```

### Configuration
- The compatable defconfig for non-ultrascale Zynq board (as Zedboard and Zybo) : **xilinx_zynq_virt_defconfig**
- Verify the **.dts** file inside folder **u-boot-xlnx/arch/arm/dts** for Zedboard(at the moment I wrote this guidance 01/07/2025) : **zynq-zed.dts**

```
# inside u-boot-xlnx
touch buildUboot.sh
chmod 777 buildUboot.sh

gedit buildUboot.sh

# copy all lines below to the buildUboot.sh without modifying it
# Set up the environment for cross-build (arm toolchain required)
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
export ARCH=arm
# Clean previous build
make distclean
# Configure the build for a zynq board. This generates a .config file that may be modified for fine-tuning
make xilinx_zynq_virt_defconfig 
# Export the device tree (based on the selected .dts file)
export DEVICE_TREE="zynq-zed"
# Build
make -j $(nproc)
```

Then run **buildUboot.sh** copy **u-boot.elf** to LinuxZedboard folder

```
./buildUboot.sh
cp u-boot.elf ../
cd ../
```

At the end of this procedure some important elements have been generated :
    - (repo-rootdir)/u-boot.elf : the u-boot binary.
    - (repo-rootdir)/tools/mkimage : used to bundle the kernel/generate boot.scr in the next steps of the tutorial.
