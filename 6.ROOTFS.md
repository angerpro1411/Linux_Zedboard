# Set-up ROOTFS
As introduction, we will use Linaro-Ubuntu for ROOTFS.
The quickest way, just download it in the internet.
According to "_https://digilent.com/reference/_media/zedboard_gswel_guide.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOor9oHCeDbKdF7ua6TCsqFNpkaMbwvyRVXPW1L9Zaz4eL_4e4x55_". \
We can download it at "_https://releases.linaro.org/_". I don't want to use bash command to download the patch because it is getting older by the time, so after several years, the link doesn't exist anymore.
In my opinion, go direct "https://releases.linaro.org/" then /ubuntu/images/developer/latest/ . You can find the latest version. \
At the moment I wrote this, I download "linaro-vivid-developer-20151215-714.tar.gz"
```
# go to download folder
ls
# -> linaro-vivid-developer-20151215-714.tar.gz
sudo tar -xJvf linaro-vivid-developer-20151215-714.tar.gz

#Go inside
cd linaro-vivid-developer-20151215-714/binary/

ls -la
# -> Must return the folders as bin,dev,home,mnt,proc,... -> Linaro system folders

# mount mmcblk0p2 - ROOTFS
sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt
sudo rsync -av . /mnt
sudo umount /mnt
```
