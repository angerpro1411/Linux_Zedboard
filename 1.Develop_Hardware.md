# Develop hardware - Device tree file - FSBL(First stage boot loader)
> ⚠️ _Note: It is mandatory to install all xilinx software as Vivado, Vitis. Vitis goes with XSCT(Xilinx command-line tools), can help us run Xilinx script without using Vitis_ \
> Create an alias in .bashrc to help running XSCT in current folder. \
> or if you don't have a habit of using it, then add "_alias xsct='source /PATH-TO-VITIS/VITIS-VERSION/settings64.sh; xsct_'".

## Peripheral utilisation
For simplicity, in this tutorial we only use 8 Leds on Zedboard
| Offset  | Name     | Access  | Description  |
| :-----: | :------: | :----:  | :--:         |
| 0       |   led    | RW      | on board LEDs|

## Implementation
According to the guidance of [1] - Zedboard, we create a project that Zynq will control 8 leds. Read carefully every step, note down the **_Offset Address_**(ex 0x4120_0000)
and _its range_(default is 64k) inside _Address Editor_. Following till the step **Export Hardware** remember **Include bitstream**, then close Vivado.
After that, inside this project folder, there are 2 files that we need - we assume that they got name as below, anyway they are .bit and .xsa(Vivado > 2019):
1. bitstream.bit (bitstream file)
2. design_1.xsa (exported hardware file)

### Download device tree resource Xilinx
Xilinx has a git repo to help in the generation of the board device tree : https://github.com/Xilinx/device-tree-xlnx
The repository is organized in multiple branches targeting specific versions of Vivado. According to your **Vivado's version**, It is **_Very crucial_** choosing the right branch corresponding to 
Vivado's version or maybe the same year or you never know why it doesn't work.
In my experiment, I was using Vivado 2023.1. Therefore, the Xilinx's folder that I downloaded always had branch version as 2023.1 or atleast 2023.

``` shell
#create a folder to contain all working files, with me LinuxZedboard
mkdir LinuxZedboard
cd LinuxZedboard

#clone the matching version
git clone -b xlnx_rel_v2023.1 https://github.com/Xilinx/device-tree-xlnx
```

### Building files
**Explaination** :
- XSCT : the path to the xsct binary in Vitis installation
- XSA_FILE : the path toward the .xsa file generated in step 1
- XILINX_DTG : the path to the xilinx device tree generator folder "device-tree-xlnx"
- BUILD_PATH : a valid path to hold temporary data
- OUTPUT_PATH : a valid path where important files will be copied

Firstly, create a xsct_script.tcl inside the same folder **LinuxZedboard**:
``` xsct_script.tcl
# create file
touch xsct_script.tcl

# allow to run script
chmod 777 xsct_script.tcl

# modify xsct_script.tcl with gedit or nano, vim,...
gedit xsct_script.tcl

# copy all lines below into script without modifying it
# Build parameters
set XSA_FILE [lindex $::argv 0]
set XILINX_DTG [lindex $::argv 1]
set BUILD_DIR [lindex $::argv 2]
set OUTPUT_DIR [lindex $::argv 3]

# Open design + set repo path for device tree
hsi::open_hw_design $XSA_FILE
hsi::set_repo_path $XILINX_DTG

# Generate FSBL
hsi::generate_app -hw [hsi::current_hw_design] -os standalone -proc ps7_cortexa9_0 -app zynq_fsbl -compile -sw fsbl -dir $BUILD_DIR
exec cp $BUILD_DIR/executable.elf $OUTPUT_DIR/fsbl.elf

# Generate  + Compile device tree
hsi::create_sw_design device-tree -os device_tree -proc ps7_cortexa9_0
hsi::generate_target -dir $BUILD_DIR/my_dts
cd $BUILD_DIR/my_dts
exec gcc -E -nostdinc -undef -D__DTS__ -x assembler-with-cpp -o device-tree.dts system-top.dts
exec dtc -I dts -O dtb -o $OUTPUT_DIR/device-tree.dtb $BUILD_DIR/my_dts/device-tree.dts

# Close design
hsi close_hw_design [hsi::current_hw_design]
```

Secondly, create a build.sh inside the same folder **LinuxZedboard**:
``` build.sh
# create file
touch build.sh

# allow to run script
chmod 777 build.sh

# modify xsct_script.tcl with gedit or nano, vim,...
gedit build.sh

# -> then copy all lines below into build.sh and modify them.

#! /bin/bash

# Set your build parameters here
XSCT=/PATH_TO_VITIS/VITIS_VERSION/bin/xsct
XSA_FILE=/PATH_TO_EXPORTED_HARDWARE_FILE/design_1.xsa
XILINX_DTG=/PATH_TO_THIS_FOLDER/LinuxZedboard/device-tree-xlnx
BUILD_PATH=/tmp/build_dir
OUTPUT_PATH=/tmp/output_dir
###########################################

# Do not edit past this point
BUILD_DIR=$(realpath ${BUILD_PATH})
OUTPUT_DIR=$(realpath ${OUTPUT_PATH})

## Prepare BUILD_DIR
if test -d ${BUILD_DIR}; then
  rm -rf ${BUILD_DIR}/*
else
  mkdir -p ${BUILD_PATH}
fi

## Prepare OUTPUT_DIR
if test -d ${OUTPUT_DIR}; then
  rm  -rf ${OUTPUT_DIR}/fsbl.elf
  rm  -rf ${OUTPUT_DIR}/device-tree.dtb
  echo "Deleting old files ..."
else
  mkdir -p ${OUTPUT_DIR}
fi

${XSCT} xsct_script.tcl ${XSA_FILE} ${XILINX_DTG} ${BUILD_DIR} ${OUTPUT_DIR}
```
After that run build.sh, inside _/tmp/output_dir_ copy 2 files **device-tree.dtb** and **fsbl.elf** into folder LinuxZedboard. And also **bitstream.bit**
```
# in the same LinuxZedboard folder run this command
cp /tmp/output_dir/* .
```
