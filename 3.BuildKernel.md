# Setup/Cross-compiling the Linux kernel

## Linux kernel for dummies

The linux kernel is the main component of the Linux operating system and acts as an interface between the hardware and the processes. Its main tasks are :
- Memory management
- Process management
- Hardware management
- Interfacing with userland using syscalls
- Implementing security features

## Implementation

### Download device tree resource Xilinx
Xilinx has a git repo to help in the generation of the board device tree : https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx
The repository is organized in multiple branches targeting specific versions of Vivado. According to your **Vivado's version**, It is **_Very crucial_** choosing the right branch corresponding to 
Vivado's version or maybe the same year or you never know why it doesn't work.
In my experiment, I was using Vivado 2023.1. Therefore, the Xilinx's folder that I downloaded always had branch version as 2023.1 or atleast 2023.

```shell
# In the same folder LinuxZedboard
# Clone the repo with the matching branch
git clone -b xlnx_rebase_v6.1_LTS_2023.1_update https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx
cd linux-xlnx
```

### Configuration
- The compatable defconfig for non-ultrascale Zynq board (as Zedboard and Zybo) : **xilinx_zynq_defconfig**
- The kernel can be configured using the classic **make menuconfig** command to select fine-tuning options.
While this command may be relevant for an exotic build, it may be skipped in the context of the tutorial.
- The kernel must be built with the knowledge of the RAM address where it will be mapped for execution during the boot process.
This is done by exporting the environment variable **UIMAGE_LOADADDR**. It is recommended to select the value **0x200000** to 
follow this tutorial (other value are possible but it must not overlap with other boot components such as u-boot or device-tree). 
Whichever value you choose, be sure to note it down for future reference in this tutorial.
- Normally, the kernel build generates **Image** and **zImage** files in **arch/arm/boot/uImage**. The former is the generic Linux 
kernel binary image file while the latter is a compressed version that is self-extracting. Those files cannot be used natively by 
u-boot which requires a special wrapped image called **uImage** generated using the **mkimage** tool generated as an output product 
of the u-boot build (refer to tutorial 2). This can be done automatically by the kernel makefile if the directory containing **mkimage** is 
found in the PATH during the compilation. For this reason, this path is appended to PATH.

```shell
touch buildKernel.sh
chmod 777 buildKernel.sh

gedit buildKernel.sh

# copy all lines below to buildKernel.sh with modifying the some Paths
# Set up the environment for cross-build (arm toolchain required)
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
export ARCH=arm
# Add mkimage to PATH to generate uImage
export PATH={PATH-TO-ABSOLUTE-UBOOT-TOOL-DIRECTORY}:$PATH
# Clean previous build
make distclean
# Configure the build for a zynq board. This generates a .config file that may be modified for fine-tuning
make xilinx_zynq_defconfig
# Configure the kernel (skippable for vanilla builds). Or just skip it.
make menuconfig
# Build the u-boot wrapped kernel image with the load address information
make UIMAGE_LOADADDR=0x200000 uImage -j $(nproc)
# Build the additional modules
make modules -j $(nproc)
```

Then run buildKernel.sh and copy uImage out to LinuxZedboard folder
```
./buildKernel.sh
cp ./arch/arm/boot/uImage ../
cd ../
```

At the end of this procedure some important elements have been generated :

    - (repo-rootdir)/arch/arm/boot/uImage : the uImage binary.
    - (repo-rootdir)/drivers/*/*.ko : various kernel modules (unused in this tutorial).
